## Project structure
The project is called `recipify`.  It currently consists of a single app `recipes`.

## Deployed version of the application
The deployed version of the application can be found at [*enter url here*](*enter_url_here*).

## Installation instructions
To install the software and use it in your local development environment, you must first set up and activate a local development environment.  The project source code has been developed using Python 3.12, so you are recommended to use the same version.  From the root of the project:

```
$ python3.12 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

If your system does not have `python3.12` installed and you are unable to install Python 3.12 as a version you can explicitly refer to from the CLI, then replace `python3.12` by `python3` or `python`, provide this employs a relatively recent version of Python.

Install all required packages:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Migrate the database:

```
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```

Seed the development database with:

```
$ python3 manage.py seed
```

Run all tests with:
```
$ python3 manage.py test
```
